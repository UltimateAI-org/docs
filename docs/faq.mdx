### ðŸ’¡ Why Docker?
We understand Docker might not be everyone's preference; however, this approach is central to our project's design and operational efficiency. We view the project's commitment to Docker as a fundamental aspect and encourage those looking for different deployment methods to explore community-driven alternatives.

#### **Q: Why am I asked to sign up? Where are my data being sent to?**

**A:** We require you to sign up to become the admin user for enhanced security. This ensures that if the Open WebUI is ever exposed to external access, your data remains secure. It's important to note that everything is kept local. We do not collect your data. When you sign up, all information stays within your server and never leaves your device. Your privacy and security are our top priorities, ensuring that your data remains under your control at all times.
